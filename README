YODO MARIO
==========

You can only play this game once. Each time you die, the game glitches out a little more until it is unplayable. For two players. Play as Mario or as the ground - try to move your chasm to make him fall in! 

P1 controls: 
  UP - Jump

P2 Controls:
  Space - Move chasms, control enemy direction

This is a clone of Infinite Mario, written in JavaScript for web browsers using HTML5.

A good demonstration of what can be accomplished with the Canvas and Audio elements.

Background music currently does not work in any browser besides Firefox 4. I think. There were too many problems with other browsers.

Ported from the Java version by Notch (Markus Persson).
